This is an essentially empty project that demonstrates how to set up a multi-scene pygame apllication.  It also demonstrates how to use the pygame.movie module.

Hello Everyone

This is how the battle system works
Player enters the battle, it picks a random Linguamon (enemy) from a list. Each enemy has certain words associated with it
The enemy has a shield and it's as strong as how many words the enemy has in it's list
The battle starts and the word is displayed then the user has to pick between 4 choices (these are set in the linguamon list)
If they get it right they damage the shield
Then the enemy attacks and it deals damage to the player
Once the shield is down you have to translate the Linguamon's name 
Once you do that you destroy the Linguamon
